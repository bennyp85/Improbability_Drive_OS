## Project Description

ImprobabilityOS is a fictional operating system inspired by the Improbability Drive from Douglas Adams' beloved series, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*. This OS is designed to manipulate probabilities, enabling users to achieve highly improbable outcomes with certainty. It is a playful exploration of the boundaries of technology and probability, reflecting the whimsical nature of its source material.

## Key Features

- **Probability Manipulation Engine:** The core component that alters probabilities to achieve desired outcomes.
- **Quantum State Manager:** Handles quantum-level operations to ensure precise probability manipulation.
- **User Interface (UI) Module:** A user-friendly interface for interacting with the OS.
- **Safety and Fail-Safe Protocols:** Prevents misuse or unintended consequences.
- **Learning and Adaptation Algorithms:** Improves performance over time through adaptive learning.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Ensure your spaceship is equipped with a quantum computer.**
2. **Insert the quantum disc labeled "ImprobabilityOS" into your spaceship's drive.**
3. **Invoke the Improbability Field by chanting "Babel fish, Babel fish" three times.**
4. **Reboot your spaceship and enjoy the wonders of ImprobabilityOS.**

## Usage Examples

```bash
probos manipulate --target=ArriveAtMagrathea
